# cloud-resume-backend

This is the backend for my Cloud Resume project. 

Cloud Resume Github: https://github.com/erhallow/cloud-resume
Live Website: https://erichallow.com/

I made a Cloud Formation template to create a Lambda function, DynamoDB table, and API Gateway.

The Lambda Function is coded to add one to the vistor count on every site visit with an API call.
